This project is a backend system built using FastAPI to manage projects and track tasks efficiently. It follows Clean Architecture principles and provides a secure, scalable, and well-structured RESTful API for handling task workflows within teams.

The system allows users to create and manage projects, assign tasks, and track their progress through a defined lifecycle. It enforces valid task status transitions and supports role-based access control to ensure proper authorization across different user roles.
